> Your Gateway to the Future of Ticketing: Collect, Trade, and Earn with Ease.

A ticketing platform (and event organising platform in future) where the organisations can issue tickets which can be buy by a user. The organisation can be anyone who is organising an offline event, movie production, etc. This seems like a normal ticket platform but the catch here it feels like web2 platform but most of the crucial components in it will be of web3, though the user will be using it as a normal web2 platform. Our platform will use Account Abstraction to provide the best UX possible in the industry, the tickets will be an NFT minted gasless by the user through paying ticket price in fiat, no metamask or traditional wallet require simple google sign in, and NFTs will be cross chain assets for those who want more security.
